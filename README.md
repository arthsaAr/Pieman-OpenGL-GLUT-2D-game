# 🎮 Pieman Game (OpenGL + GLUT)

A simple 2D arcade-style game inspired by *Pac-Man*, created in C++ using **OpenGL** and **GLUT**.  
The game features a player-controlled "Pieman" who moves around a maze eating pellets. The movement keys are the arrow keys.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Implemented entirely in **one file** (`main.cpp`) for simplicity.
- Uses **colors** to represent walls, pellets, and the Pieman (no textures required).
- Real-time keyboard input for movement.
- Basic collision detection with walls.
- Smooth rendering and animation using GLUT display callbacks.
